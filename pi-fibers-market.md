<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PI Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PI fibers are produced using two main spinning methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving the PI polymer in a solvent and extruding it through spinnerets into a coagulation bath, resulting in fibers with high strength and modulus. Dry spinning, on the other hand, involves spinning the PI polymer solution directly into a heated air stream, which evaporates the solvent and solidifies the fibers. Both methods have their own benefits and are used in various applications across industries.</p></p>
