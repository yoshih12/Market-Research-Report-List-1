<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-phase Distribution Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Type</li><li>Oil Immersed Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The three-phase distribution transformer market consists of two main types: dry type and oil immersed type. Dry type transformers are designed to be operated in open-air environments and use non-flammable insulation materials, making them safer and more suitable for indoor installations where fire protection is crucial. On the other hand, oil immersed transformers are filled with insulating oil, which enhances their cooling efficiency and insulation properties. These transformers are commonly used in outdoor installations, such as power distribution substations, where flammability is less of a concern.</p></p>
