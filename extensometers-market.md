<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extensometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Extensometers</li><li>Non-contact Extensometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extensometers are devices used to measure and monitor the deformation or strain of a material. There are two main types of extensometers: contact extensometers and non-contact extensometers.</p><p>Contact extensometers require physical contact with the material being measured. They typically use clips or gripping jaws to attach to the surface of the material and measure its deformation. Contact extensometers are often used in mechanical testing, where precise measurements of strain are necessary.</p><p>On the other hand, non-contact extensometers do not require direct contact with the material. They use optical or video-based methods to measure deformation without physically touching the material. Non-contact extensometers are commonly used when the material's surface needs to remain intact or if it is difficult to access.</p><p>Both contact and non-contact extensometers play crucial roles in various industries, including manufacturing, construction, and research, providing valuable data for quality control, material testing, and structural analysis.</p></p>
