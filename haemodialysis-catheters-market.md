<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Haemodialysis Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cuffed Tunneled</li><li>Non-cuffed Tunneled</li><li>Non-tunneled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Haemodialysis Catheters market consists of three types: Cuffed Tunneled, Non-cuffed Tunneled, and Non-tunneled catheters. Cuffed Tunneled catheters include a cuff that secures the catheter in place by tunneling it under the skin. Non-cuffed Tunneled catheters lack a cuff but are still tunneled under the skin. Non-tunneled catheters are inserted directly into the vein without any tunneling. Each type has unique benefits and considerations, catering to different patient needs and medical requirements in the market.</p></p>
