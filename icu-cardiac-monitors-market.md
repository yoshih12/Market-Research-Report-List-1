<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICU Cardiac Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardiac Monitors</li><li>Conventional Cardiac Monitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICU Cardiac Monitors are medical devices used to monitor the heart's activity in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). There are two main types of ICU Cardiac Monitors - Implantable Cardiac Monitors (ICMs) and Conventional Cardiac Monitors. ICMs are small devices that are implanted under the skin to continuously monitor a patient's heart rhythm and detect any abnormalities. Conventional Cardiac Monitors, on the other hand, are external devices that are temporarily attached to a patient's body and provide real-time monitoring of the heart's electrical activity, blood pressure, and other vital signs.</p></p>
