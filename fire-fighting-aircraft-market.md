<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Fighting Aircraft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Fire Aircraft</li><li>Land Firefighting Aircraft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire fighting aircraft can be categorized into two types: water fire aircraft and land firefighting aircraft. Water fire aircraft are specifically designed to combat wildfires by dropping water or fire retardants from tanks or scooping water from nearby water sources. These aircraft are highly efficient in suppressing fires and preventing their spread. On the other hand, land firefighting aircraft are used to transport firefighters, equipment, and supplies to remote fire-prone areas. These aircraft typically have the capability to land on rugged terrains and provide logistical support to ground firefighting efforts.</p></p>
