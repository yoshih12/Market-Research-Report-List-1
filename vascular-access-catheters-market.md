<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Access Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-microbial Catheter</li><li>Non Anti-microbial Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vascular access catheters are medical devices used to achieve and maintain access to the bloodstream. Anti-microbial catheters have coatings or impregnations with substances that help prevent the growth of microorganisms on the surface of the catheter, reducing the risk of infections. On the other hand, non anti-microbial catheters lack these specific features and rely on other infection prevention measures like proper care and regular replacement. Both types serve the purpose of providing a route for administration of medications, fluids, or drawing blood but differ in terms of infection protection capabilities.</p></p>
