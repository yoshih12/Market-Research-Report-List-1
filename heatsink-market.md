<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heatsink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Heatsink</li><li>Passive Heatsink</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The heatsink market can be divided into two types: active heatsinks and passive heatsinks. Active heatsinks are equipped with fans or other cooling mechanisms to actively dissipate heat from electronic components. They are more effective in cooling down high-performance devices, but may produce noise. On the other hand, passive heatsinks rely on natural conduction and convection to dissipate heat without the need for additional components. They are typically smaller, lighter, and quieter, but less efficient in cooling powerful devices.</p></p>
