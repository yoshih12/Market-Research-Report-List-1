<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intra Uterine Contraceptive Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Copper IUCD</li><li>Hormonal IUCD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intra Uterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCDs) are a type of birth control method that are inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. There are two main types of IUCDs: Copper IUCDs and Hormonal IUCDs. </p><p>Copper IUCDs work by releasing copper ions into the uterus, which creates a toxic environment for sperm and eggs, preventing fertilization and implantation. Hormonal IUCDs, on the other hand, release a small amount of progestin hormone, which thickens the cervical mucus and inhibits the sperm's ability to reach the egg. Both types of IUCDs are highly effective and provide long-term contraception.</p></p>
