<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Patient Cooling Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Cooling Systems</li><li>Intravascular Cooling Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface cooling systems and intravascular cooling systems are two types of patient cooling devices used in the medical field. Surface cooling systems work by applying cooling pads or blankets to a patient's skin to lower their body temperature. Intravascular cooling systems, on the other hand, involve circulating cooled saline solution through catheters that are inserted into the patient's bloodstream, effectively cooling their core body temperature. Both types of systems are used to manage and treat conditions such as fever, cardiac arrest, and traumatic brain injury.</p></p>
