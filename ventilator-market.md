<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilator market consists of two main types: non-invasive ventilators and invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators are designed to deliver oxygen to a patient without the need for intubation or insertion of a breathing tube. They are used in cases where the patient can breathe spontaneously but requires assistance. Invasive ventilators, on the other hand, are used when a patient is unable to breathe independently and requires intubation. These ventilators deliver oxygen directly into the lungs through a breathing tube inserted into the airway.</p></p>
