<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage Gas Furnaces</li><li>Two-stage Gas Furnaces</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Gas furnaces are heating systems that use gas as fuel to generate heat. There are two main types in the market: single-stage and two-stage gas furnaces. Single-stage furnaces have only one heating level, meaning they are either on or off. In contrast, two-stage furnaces have two heating levels, allowing them to operate at a lower stage for milder weather and switch to a higher stage for colder conditions. This flexibility provides better comfort and energy efficiency, as the furnace adjusts its output according to the temperature outside.</p></p>
