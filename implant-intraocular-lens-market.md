<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implant Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-foldable Lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implant intraocular lens market consists of two main types: non-foldable lenses and foldable intraocular lenses. Non-foldable lenses are rigid and require a larger incision during surgery for implantation. They provide stable and durable vision correction but have certain limitations. Foldable intraocular lenses, as the name suggests, are flexible and can be folded for insertion through a smaller incision during surgery. They offer easier and less invasive implantation, making them a preferred choice for many surgeons and patients. Both types aim to improve vision and replace the natural lens in the eye.</p></p>
