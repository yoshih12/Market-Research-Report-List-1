<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DC Response Accelerometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitive Type</li><li>Piezoresistive Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>DC response accelerometers are sensors used to measure acceleration in various applications. Capacitive type accelerometers use a change in capacitance to measure acceleration, which is achieved by the movement of a proof mass relative to fixed capacitive plates. This change in capacitance generates an electrical signal proportional to the motion. On the other hand, piezoresistive type accelerometers use a change in resistance to measure acceleration. When the proof mass applies a force on a piezoresistive element, it deforms, causing a change in resistance that is proportional to the acceleration.</p></p>
