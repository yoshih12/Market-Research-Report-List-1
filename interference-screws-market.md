<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interference Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Screws</li><li>Non-absorbable Screws</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interference screws are commonly used in orthopedic surgeries, particularly in ligament reconstruction procedures. These screws aid in fixing tendons or ligaments to bone by creating interference or compression to enable secure fixation. Absorbable screws are made from materials like polylactic acid and gradually dissolve and get absorbed by the body over time. Non-absorbable screws, on the other hand, are made from materials such as titanium or stainless steel and remain permanently in the body. Both types of screws offer their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
