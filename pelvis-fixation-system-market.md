<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvis Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Fixation System</li><li>External Fixation System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pelvis fixation system market includes two main types: internal fixation systems and external fixation systems. Internal fixation systems involve the use of implants like plates, screws, and rods to stabilize fractures or injuries within the pelvis. This method provides internal stability and promotes faster healing. On the other hand, external fixation systems utilize external frames with pins or screws that are fixed to the pelvis. These systems are primarily used in cases where internal fixation is not possible or ideal. They provide external stability and allow for gradual realignment and healing of fractures or injuries.</p></p>
