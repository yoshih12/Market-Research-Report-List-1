<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The server cooling fans market consists of two main types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans are designed to move air parallel to the axis of rotation, generating a large volume flow rate with relatively low pressure. They are commonly used in servers to provide cooling in open environments. On the other hand, centrifugal fans move air radially, creating a higher pressure flow. They are ideal for confined spaces where higher pressure is required, making them suitable for server cooling in dense rack systems or blade servers.</p></p>
