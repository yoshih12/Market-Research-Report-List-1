<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillator Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual External</li><li>Manual Internal</li><li>Automatic External</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Defibrillator Pads market consists of three main types: Manual External, Manual Internal, and Automatic External. Manual External defibrillators require the user to apply the electrode pads to the patient's chest manually and then deliver a shock by pressing a button. Manual Internal defibrillators deliver electrical shocks directly to the patient's heart during open heart surgery or other invasive procedures. Automatic External defibrillators, on the other hand, analyze the patient's heart rhythm and deliver shocks automatically if needed, without any manual intervention. These different types cater to various medical settings and patient needs.</p></p>
