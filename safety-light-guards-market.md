<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Light Guards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>4-type Safety Light Barriers</li><li>2-type Safety Light Barriers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety light guards are an essential component for safeguarding workers and preventing accidents in industrial environments. There are two main types in the market: 4-type safety light barriers and 2-type safety light barriers. The 4-type safety light barriers employ four beams of infrared light to detect objects or personnel in a designated area, triggering a safety response when breached. On the other hand, 2-type safety light barriers utilize two beams and work similarly but are suitable for smaller areas or limited access applications. Both types help ensure workplace safety by alerting operators to potential hazards.</p></p>
