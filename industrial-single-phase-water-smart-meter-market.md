<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Single Phase Water Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Industrial Single Phase Water Smart Meter market is divided into two types: IC Card and Non-IC Card. IC Card refers to water smart meters that use an integrated circuit (IC) card as a means of payment and data exchange. These meters typically require users to prepay for water usage and offer convenient features like automatic deduction. On the other hand, Non-IC Card meters do not use a smart card for payment and data exchange, requiring manual meter reading and separate billing processes.</p></p>
