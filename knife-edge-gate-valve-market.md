<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knife Edge Gate Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bi-directional</li><li>Unidirectional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Knife edge gate valves are commonly used in industrial applications to control the flow of fluids. They are available in two types: bi-directional and unidirectional. Bi-directional knife edge gate valves are designed to regulate the flow of fluid in two opposite directions, allowing for efficient operation and flexibility. On the other hand, unidirectional knife edge gate valves only allow the fluid to flow in one direction, making them ideal for applications where backflow prevention is essential. Both types serve specific purposes in various industries, providing reliable and precise flow control solutions.</p></p>
