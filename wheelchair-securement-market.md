<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheelchair Securement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Retractable</li><li>Retractable</li><li>Docking System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wheelchair securement refers to the methods used to safely secure wheelchairs in vehicles to prevent them from moving during transportation. There are three main types of wheelchair securement systems: non-retractable, retractable, and docking systems. </p><p>Non-retractable systems use straps or belts that are manually fastened to anchor points in the vehicle to secure the wheelchair.
