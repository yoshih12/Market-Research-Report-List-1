<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intravascular Temperature Management System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravascular Warming</li><li>Intravascular Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intravascular temperature management system market comprises two types: intravascular warming and intravascular cooling. Intravascular warming refers to a method of maintaining a patient's body temperature by circulating warm fluids through a catheter inserted into the blood vessels. This helps to prevent and treat hypothermia. On the other hand, intravascular cooling involves the use of a catheter to circulate cold fluids within the blood vessels, aiding in the management of fever and hyperthermia. Both methods aim to regulate the patient's body temperature effectively.</p></p>
