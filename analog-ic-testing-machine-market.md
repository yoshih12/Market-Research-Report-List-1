<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analog IC Testing Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wafer Tester</li><li>Packaged Device Tester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Analog IC Testing Machine market is divided into two main types: Wafer Tester and Packaged Device Tester. A Wafer Tester examines the electrical performance of individual integrated circuits (ICs) while they are still in the wafer form, before they are separated into individual ICs. This helps to ensure the ICs are functioning correctly. On the other hand, a Packaged Device Tester assesses the electrical and functional properties of ICs after they have been packaged, i.e., placed inside protective casings. Both types of testers play a crucial role in ensuring the quality and reliability of analog ICs.</p></p>
