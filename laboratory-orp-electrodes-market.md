<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory ORP Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Junction</li><li>Double Junction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory ORP electrodes are used to measure oxidation-reduction potential in various scientific and industrial applications. They are available in two types: single junction and double junction. </p><p>Single junction electrodes have a single liquid junction between the sample and the electrode, allowing for faster response but are more prone to contamination. </p><p>On the other hand, double junction electrodes have an additional inner chamber that isolates the reference solution from the sample, reducing the risk of contamination but resulting in a slower response time. These options cater to different needs based on response speed and contamination concerns.</p></p>
