<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Thermal Imaging Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Initiative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive military thermal imaging cameras are designed to detect the natural heat emitted by objects and people, making them effective for covert surveillance and target acquisition. These cameras do not emit any radiation, relying solely on the heat signatures they capture. On the other hand, initiative military thermal imaging cameras, also known as active cameras, emit their own infrared radiation and then process the reflected signals to create an image. This type of camera requires its own power source and is generally used for long-range detection and target identification.</p></p>
