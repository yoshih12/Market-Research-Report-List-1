<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Needle-Free Drug Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Jet-Based</li><li>Spring-Based</li><li>Laser-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Needle-free drug delivery systems refer to a range of technologies that offer a non-invasive method of administering medications. There are three main types of needle-free drug delivery systems: jet-based, spring-based, and laser-based. Jet-based systems use high-pressure gas or liquid to create a fine jet that penetrates the skin. Spring-based systems use a spring-loaded mechanism to propel the medication into the skin. Laser-based systems use lasers to create microscopic holes in the skin, allowing drugs to be absorbed. These technologies provide a safer, painless, and more convenient alternative to traditional needle injections.</p></p>
